/**
 * An IPP attribute definition identified by a keyword and typed by an
 * {@link AbstractIppAttrSyntax}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Most attributes are defined to have a single attribute syntax. However, a few
 * attributes (e.g., "job-sheet", "media", "job-hold- until") are defined to
 * have several attribute syntaxes, depending on the value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These multiple attribute syntaxes are separated by the "|" character in the
 * sub-section heading to indicate the choice.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since each value MUST be tagged as to its attribute syntax in the protocol, a
 * single-valued attribute instance may have any one of its attribute syntaxes
 * and a multi-valued attribute instance may have a mixture of its defined
 * attribute syntaxes.
