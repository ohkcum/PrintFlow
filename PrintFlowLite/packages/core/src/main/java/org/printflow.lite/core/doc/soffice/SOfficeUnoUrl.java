/**
 * Encapsulates the UNO Interprocess Connection type and parameters.
 * <p>
 * Although OpenOffice supports two connection types: TCP sockets and named
 * pipes, we support sockets only. Reason: named pipes are only marginally
 * faster, but they require native libraries, which means setting
 * <em>java.library.path</em> when starting Java. E.g. on Linux:
 * {@code java -Djava.library.path=/opt/openoffice.org/ure/lib ...}
 *
 * <p>
 * See <a href=

 * Opening a Connection</a> in the OpenOffice.org Developer's Guide for more
 * details.
