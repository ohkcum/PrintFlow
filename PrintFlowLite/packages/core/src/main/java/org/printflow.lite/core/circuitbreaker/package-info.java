/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces implementing the <i>Circuit Breaker</i>
 * concept as described in the book "Release It!" by Michael T. Nygard.
 * <p>
 * Circuit breakers are applied to services that implement integration points to
 * external systems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If such a service returns too many errors or responds too slowly, the breaker
 * trips to {@link CircuitStateEnum#OPEN}. In this state, any client which
 * attempts to reach the service will fail fast.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the breaker has been open for some specified period of time, it will
 * move to {@link CircuitStateEnum#HALF_OPEN}, allowing the client's next
 * request to reach the service. Depending on the result of this call, the
 * circuit breaker will either move to {@link CircuitStateEnum#CLOSED} or back
 * to {@link CircuitStateEnum#OPEN}.
 * </p>
